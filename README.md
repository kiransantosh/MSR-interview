         Below are the details of the test. The test is divided into 6 steps, beginning with setting up the infrastructure to installing software and configuring the servers. Our preferred infrastructure automation tools are Terraform and Ansible, but itâ€™s not mandatory to use them. Feel free to use the tools of your choice.
